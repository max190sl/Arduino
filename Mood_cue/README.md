This code was added from a file that Max typed.
Max did not add any comments to his code.
He pushed it to his own repository from a Raspberry Pi in Sweden and then made a pull request from his browser.
I accepted his pull request and then did a ``` git fetch``` followed with a ```git merge```.
I then chose to update my GitHub repository with a ```git push``` .

Max should add my repository as a remote pointing to mine, fetch it to his computer, merge it with his files and then push it back the changes to his repository to be up to date.
```git remote jan https://github.com/vanDeventer/Arduino
git ftech jan master
git merge
git push origin master```
